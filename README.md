# Connect4Field
It is a basic connect four field game with a modified board.
A player first chooses a shape and then takes turns to drop those shapes from the top.
The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column. 
The objective of the game is to connect four of one's own shapes right next to each other in either vertical, horizontal, or diagonal direction before your opponent.
